# filler

**Not the best algorith out here, actualy not even an algorithm. I
just go for the centre if it's possible to place there, then place. If
I can nolonger place at the centre because of the enemey being too close,
I just go around them.**

## Here's how you play

**./resources/filler_vm -f ./resources/maps/map0(0/1/2) -p1 ./the_ting_goes_skraaa -p2 ./resources/players/playername**
